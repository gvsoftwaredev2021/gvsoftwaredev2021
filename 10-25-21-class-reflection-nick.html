				<li> I think I've been pretty successful at applying myself as well as meeting a couple of new people.</li>

		<h4>Software tools developement:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li> This type of software developement is essentially a foundation for other software developers.
				 The reason for this is that building tools that other developers can use makes the process faster
				 and more efficient.</li>
			</ul>
		<h4>Kanban:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li> Kanban is a more "go with the flow" type of work-flow. This allows the team using Kanban to be more
				 adaptable as well as efficient when some work times more time than others, rather than spending a
				 predetermined set amount of time on each project. Kanban uses cards and colums to categorize at which
				 stage each project or task is in.</li>
			</ul>
		<h4>Thoughts on David's work:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li> Seeing David's work was a cool experience. Him showing what his normal workflow is and how not only
				 he is involved but his co-workers as well was interesting to see.</li>
