                <h4>Steps:</h4>
                
                <p>GitHub allows us to upload html code to a repository and then acts as the host for a website using that code. User and organization websites are automatically provided with a URL of the following format: “http://username.github.io.” With that being said, we want to be able to link a custom domain name to the new class website. In our case, we want to link our custom domain name, “gvsoftwaredev2021.com,” to the GitHub pages website for our class project. Below, we provide the appropriate steps for configuring a custom domain name: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, we need to acquire a domain name. The domain name should be purchased from a reliable domain registrar. Some examples of reliable sources include GoDaddy, Google Domains, Domain.com, and freenom.</li>
                    <img src = "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/819539/GoDaddy_Logo.jpg?p=publish" alt = "GoDaddy Icon" style="width:500px;height:200px;"><img src="https://blog.webjeda.com/assets/thumbs/google-domains-vs-godaddy-namescheap.png" alt ="Google Domains Icon" style="width:300px;height:175px;">
                    <li>Next, we need to add the purchased domain name into the GitHub repository pages settings. In the repository settings, select the “Pages” tab, add the purchased domain name to the box labeled “Custom domain” and then save the current settings. This will automatically create a commit to add a “CNAME” file in the site’s repository. This will be important in later steps.</li>
                    <li>Then, we need to access the DNS management console of the domain provider. There are five records that need to be added into the console:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A “CNAME” record with the following characteristics: the type of record is “CNAME,” the name is “www,” and the value is the original GitHub link structured as username.github.io.</li>
                        <li>Four different “A” records with the following characteristics: the type of record is “A,” the name is “@,” and the value is the designated IP address. Below are the designated IP addresses from GitHub documentation:</li>
                        <ul>    
                            <li>185.199.108.153</li>
                            <li>185.199.109.153</li>
                            <li>185.199.110.153</li>
                            <li>185.199.111.153</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Finally, after accounting for the lag in the domain name provider’s DNS management process, we can access the GitHub website with the new, custom domain name. Searching for the purchased domain name will then redirect all traffic to the GitHub pages site.</li>
                </ul>
