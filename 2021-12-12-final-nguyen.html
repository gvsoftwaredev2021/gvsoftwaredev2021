Some things to consider, if you want: For course attention, I would do like to participate in the class to get points, for Zoom, turn on Video, talks to the class, ask questions, engage with the class. For the team project: they will need to vote for a team leader and each group leader should upload it on behalf of the group. Individual feedback Form will be provided for each member including the group member, we will evaluate each member’s contribution to the group project, including group leader, and the total of the group should equal 100%) </li>
