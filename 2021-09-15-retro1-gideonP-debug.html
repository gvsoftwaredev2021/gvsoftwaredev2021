	<h4> My thoughts: </h4>
  <ul>
		<li><p>I see myself becoming more conversant with software engineering techniques, having a strong knowledge with the right technologies to use in solving issues, turning multiple ideas into digital platforms with ease and spending less time in developing software applications.</p></li>
    <li><p>I also strongly believe I will be more proficient with management, technical, and teamworking skills which are essential in software engineering industry since in this area, one cannot necessarily work alone.</p></li>
