    <h4>My goal for the class</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>My goal for the class have not changed I still want to learn new things and expand my knowledge. 
            The class is going well so far and I do not have anything that I would to change. I think that git might be a great tool 
            to use for this class if everyone knew how to use it.</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Embedded Systems Development</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Embedded Systems Development which is also known as micro, systemic, embedded or device software, is permanently installed in a device and serves to execute the programmed functions which execute in a certain time.
            The other way Embedded systems might be thought of as a computer hardware system having software embedded in it. 
            Embedded systems can work independently or as an element connected with another system.
            Embedded System does not require the introduction of data because it works without supervision and is not operated by a user.
            It is a microcontroller or microprocessor-based on the system which is designed to perform a specific task.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Agile</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Agile methodology is a type of incremental approach to software development based on principles that focuses more on people, results, collaboration, and flexible responses to change.
                It help break down the project development process in small increments completed in iterations or short time frames.
                Some of the advantages of using Agile model are : <br> the process is completely based on the incremental process. Therefore, the client and team know exactly what is complete and what is not. which reduces the risk i the developement process.
                It is focused client process, so it makes sure that the client is continiously involved  during every stage.
                Agile teams are extremely motivasted and self-organized so it likely to provide a better result from the development project.
                Agile methology is flexible. Agile can be considered as a collection of many different projects. Agile also promotes efficient communicationa and ideal for projects with non-fixed funding.
                Even though Agile have a lot of benefits it also have some disadvantages. some of them are:<br> Agile recommends co-location for efficient communication, which is not always possible.
                Agile assumes every project team member is completely dedicated, without which weakens the principle of self-management.
                Agile requires a high degree of customer involvement, which not all customers are comfortable with or prefer to give.
