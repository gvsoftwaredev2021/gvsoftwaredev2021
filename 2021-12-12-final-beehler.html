				<li> Have the students take on specific rolls during the sprint. </li>
				<li> Get feedback from team (students) on how each sprint went. Successes and failures. </li>
				<li> Use feedback to determine participation and grading scale. </li>

		<h4>Instructor Notes</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>"The importance of keeping a time log. ": Shows where lagging, where efficient, where needs help. Was a helpful reminder of previous habit. Also identifies distractions.
				
				<li>"Use feedback to determine participation and grading scale.": Sometimes folks aren't as engaged on different tasks. At work, use retros to identify people who aren't pulling their weight. Don't know how to do it in classroom setting ("looks good on paper").
				
				<li>"When is software development as a group a bad idea? ": forming means getting to know each other. Storming means working through differences. In some teams, its invisible, in some other teams, some individuals say, "my way or the highway". Never got past forming in the class since it takes time (it takes 6-8 months to "perform").
