			<h4> Assignment: </h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The goal of this week's assignment is to write a brief description of each assignment that we have developed over the course of the semester</li>
				<li>On the website, this will give the reader some context as to what the assignments are and the goals or motivations behind them</li>
				<li>We will begin the assignment on Monday Nov. 22 and it will be due on Friday Nov. 26 at 11:59 PM (it should be completed well before this)</li>
				<li>All submissions will be emailed to evan.callaghan@grandview.edu in the form of HTML scripts (one submission per group)</li>
				<li>All submissions must follow the CSS style voted upon by the class (using the external CSS file provided by Craig on Nov. 8)</li>
				<li>All submissions must match the format provided in our example post</li>
			</ul>

			<h4> Monday Class: </h4>
			<ul>
				<li>First, we will designate a previous class assignment to each student group (see below for student groups and assignments)</li>
				<li>The group will then enter a Zoom breakout room to spend the class period discussing/writing a description of the assignment and writing a few sentences about how they interpreted/attacked the problem at hand</li>
				<li>At the end of the class period, every student group will share what they wrote for their designated assignment</li>
				<li>Before the end of class, the group must email their assignment descriptions to their partner grouping (see partner groupings below)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h4> Next Steps: </h4>
			<ul>
				<li>After sending your written description to your partner grouping, you are responsible for reviewing, editing, suggesting the description that they send to you</li>
				<li>Please add detail where the group may have left it out</li>
				<li>The goal is to provide appropriate details as to what each assignment represents to the website reader, so it must be accurate and detailed</li>
				<li>In total, the description should be between four and eight sentences, depending on the assignment</li>
				<li>Make the edits and revisions, and email the final results back to the group (they are then responsible for submitting to the above email address)</li>
				<li>Submissions are due before 11:59 PM on Friday Nov. 26, but it should not take this long to complete the assignment</li>
				<li>Once we recieve a submission from each group and check to make sure it is detailed and is formatted correctly, we will create a pull request with all files</li>
			</ul>
