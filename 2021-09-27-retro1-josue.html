            <li>I think it would be exciting and stressful at the same time. It would be stressful when I got stuck on something that I do not know how to fix and also, It might be stressful because of the deadlines, 
            sometimes it is hard to meet the deadline when i have other things to or when it is the first time doing that project.</li>
            <br>
