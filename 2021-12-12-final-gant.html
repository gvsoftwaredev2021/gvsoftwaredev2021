	<h4>What is Software Development?</h4>
		<p>Software development is the process of brainstorming, designing, programming and fitting together components that create software.</p>

	<h4>What's the top 1 (or 2 or 3) lessons you learned from the course?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Basic HTMl code</li>
		<li>How to style a webpage/website</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>What were the stated learning objectives for the course?</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn the full software development lifecycle, and how to use UML and coding practices to help move an idea from the software designer to the end-user. </li>
			<li>Old and new models of software development.</li>
			<li>Automated and manual testing that 1) software works as intended, and 2) the software’s features do not regress over time.</li>
			<li>Working as a team, and presenting the results of that work.</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>When is software development as a group a bad idea?</h4>
		<p>Software development as a group is bad when there isn’t a set plan- so your team isn’t all on the same page-, when you’re working with a software that doesn’t allow multiple users to work at once and when there isn’t an end goal. If you don’t know what you’re trying to accomplish, it’s going to make being productive and efficient with a team a lot more complicated.<p>


	<h4>Describe the software development process used for the class site.</h4>
		<p>We started out coding a few assignments to test how our website will look and what it will include. Then the further we got into the semester we really took a step back to analyze what we wanted to accomplish. All of us took an idea and planned how we would involve the class to improve a certain apart of our website. We used what we had already implemented, improved it and have been maintaining it over the last couple of months. We have also been testing the pages to be certain they mee the class criteria and are up to current standards.</p>


	<h4>Which processes that you read about most resemble what we did? Which resembled it the least? </h4>
		<p>The process we did most of was designing. We had groups do formatting, styling, coloring, grammar checks, etc. It wasn’t much work to do the given assignment but making sure it passed each stage we have been working towards was where most time was spent! I would also have to say we did a lot of maintenance since we had quite a few assignments we had to go back and implement our newest styling, grammar, formats, etc. into to make them mesh into the website! The process we least focused on was testing. Personally, I didn’t look at anyone else’s pages unless I was told to. I worried most about my own pages where I should have been looking at others to help us as a team and improve my overall HTML knowledge because you can always learn from your classmate’s work!</p>

	<h4>What were the goals of the development process we used?</h4>
		<p>Our main goal was to create a website that would show what we -as a team- worked on all semester. Have something we can look back at tomorrow or in a couple years and see what we learned and how we can implement what we did in class into another desired area. Working as a team is very crucial in the real world so working with other students, taking instructions, criticism and feedback was a very beneficial experience. I think the students in our class managed it very well and we have a positive takeaway from this class whether it be basic HTML knowledge, communication, teamwork, time management, etc., which was also part of our individual goals we talked about at the start of class!</p>
 

	<h4>If you're to teach the course, how would you do it?</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>What grading scheme, if any, would you use?</li>
				<p>I would grade on the time and quality put into their work. I know I am not the best at HTML so my work might not be as fancy as other students. With the assignment being turned in, I would ask for a short reflection on the positives and negatives of the assignment. I always keep notes if I don’t understand something to talk/email to my professor. This allows my professor to see my thought process and efforts to solve my issues. I think these reflections will show the professor how engaged students are and how much they know that can be referred to when grading assignments! Then at the end of the semester, I would use the basic percentage chart to determine a final grade.</p>

			<li>Missed class policy/ Late policy?</li>
				<p>I feel like a lot of people might disagree with me on this, but if the student is doing well in my class and completing all assigned work, I wouldn’t worry about their attendance. If I start to see a student that is falling behind and not coming to class, then I would take that up with that student. Life is unexpected and I will start by giving the benefit of the doubt to the students that they are figuring things out and doing all they can to make it to class. I also think that students being late isn’t an issue as ling as they are also staying caught up and not being a disturbance when they enter class.</p>

			<li>Late homework policy?</li>
				<p>Being an athlete and triple major, I have had times where I have had to ask for an extension or completely forgot about an assignment. Mistakes happen and I think late policies are good because if you don’t allow late work, it can make students unmotivated if they start to struggle. I would do like a 15% reduction in grade for late work unless the student talks to me and we make adjustments based on the situation. </p>

			<li>Missed homework policy?</li>
				<p>There isn’t anything I would do about missed homework unless a student comes and asks how to improve their grade and they are missing work. I’m not going to pester students to turn in their homework, they either do or they don’t.</p>

		<h4>Instructor Notes</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>"criticism and feedback was a very beneficial ": Retros are good. Makes people feel good to get kudos. Not so much in other classes. In soccer, feedback sometimes in practice. And sometimes picks an example from recorded games.There's an analogy between our time logs and game recordings in soccer.
		
			<li>" With the assignment being turned in, I would ask for a short reflection on the positives and negatives of the assignment.": Started doing this in math classes. Was good at it until calc 3. Instead of leaving answer blank, showing thinking helps professor understand thinking, and sometimes get unstuck. I think this might be better alternative to time logs --ed
			
			<li>"Software development as a group is bad when there isn’t a set plan": Have taken classes in coaching. Some people are visual while some are audio learners. In sports, explain to everyone, then show a visual, then walk through the drill, then ask if they have questions, before having the students do it. Note that if one person speaks up, others might have the same problem but are too scared to.
			
			<li>"If you're to teach the course, how would you do it?": Based on policy in other classes. Skip penalties if you have insight into what's causing lateness or missed work.
			
			<li>Kudos for giving Madeline kudos on Friday class. What makes a good teammate?: Seems focused in class, so trusts. Takes initiative (?). Is constructive in feedback (try this instead of that). Madeline gives good feedback so felt like giving good feedback in return. Quick response to email. She did my work once so felt like doing her work at some point.
