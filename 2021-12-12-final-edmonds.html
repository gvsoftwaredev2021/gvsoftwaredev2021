            <h4>Software Development: In General</h4>

            
            <p>What is "software development"?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Software development is creating and designing products for client use.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>What's the top 1 (or 2 or 3) lessons you learned from the course?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to use GitHub Pull Requests and how it benefits group projects</li>
                    <li>How to work in different groups to accomplish different tasks</li>
                    <li>Presenting/Teaching a class. To create an assignment with a deadline and answer questions pertaining to that assignment.</li>                        
                </ul>
            <p>What were the stated learning objectives for the course?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn about Software Development, its lifecycle, and how to use it</li>
                    <li>View different models of Software Development</li>
                    <li>Learn how to test software features and prevent them from failing after constant use</li>
                    <li>Work with other students to create a website showcasing what we’ve learned through the semester.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>When is software development as a group a bad idea?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Software development in group settings can be a bad idea in two settings:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Group members are not on the same programming level. For example, if you have a member who is very knowledgeable about the coding language that is paired with someone who isn’t as fluent in that language, more time will be spent catching that member up on the language rather than the project itself. The more knowledgeable member may be pressured to complete the assignment on their own.</li>
                        <li>There isn’t enough work for the number of group members. There could be an assignment given to a group of three, however only two members are needed to accomplish the task. This leaves the third group member without work to do which can lead to a demotivated team.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>    
                                        
            <p>Describe the software development process used for the class site</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the class the process was at the beginning of the week, students were given a topic and/or a group member. The goal was to create original researched content about the topic, then to code the response in the given format assigned to the class. During the projects, we would have check ins to see how everyone is progressing.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Which processes that you read about most resemble what we did? Which resembled it the least?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For this class, closest process we used was Scrum. Scrum is a fast-paced process that uses “sprints” to create and develop projects that work to an end goal. It resembles our class because every week a new topic could be thought of as a sprint project, with all of the topics combining into our main website.</li>
                    <li>The furthest process from our class would be Waterfall. Waterfall is the process of working in a lifecycle of the project. For example, if we followed that guideline our class would’ve started with the basics of HTML/CSS, and we would’ve spent the last few weeks actually coding the website itself. </li>
                </ul>
            <p>What were the goals of the development process we used?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check-ins/Morning meetings</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Having students speak to the class on what they have done or what needs to be done for the projects</li>
                            <li>This is also the time to provide follow up questions, if any</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>New Assignments/Group Projects every week</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assignment is given at the beginning of the week and due at the end of the week. Students will get in contact with their group members to discuss how to tackle the assignment and carry out that plan.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Organizing the GitHub/Keeping the Pull Request area clear after every project</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is no confusion on the assignments being turned in. During the student teaching week it was easy for instructors to go through the PRs and know that those requests will follow the format given to the students. Also because all HTML files followed the same naming pattern, there is no confusion looking directly at the GitHub</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

            <h4>Software Development: My POV</h4>
            
            <p>If you're to teach the course, how would you do it? Some things to consider, if you want:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What grading scheme, if any, would you use?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The important things to look out for</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Are assignments turned in on time?</li>
                                    <li>Are the requirements met?</li>
                                    <li>Is the student on time to class?</li>
                                    <li>Is the student participating in discussions/group work?</li>
                                </ul>   
                            <li>If all requirements are met, the student deserves an A. if the requirement is not being met, the student doesn’t deserve a high grade.</li>                                
                        </ul>
                    <li>Late policy?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As long as the student is not disruptive upon entry, they can attend the class. They are responsible for ensuring their attendance is recorded AFTER class has ended and any notes they have missed. Depending on how late the student is, this can deduct the points from participation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Missed class policy?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If students have missed a class, they are responsible for rewatching the class recordings or looking to the sent-out notes to see what the assignment is. They are not excused from the late policy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Late homework policy?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not accept assignments after a day unless there is a valid reason for an extension. A day later can also have a point deduction, if applicable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Missed homework policy?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the student fails to provide the homework assignment, even after the day after grace period, that assignment receives a zero.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>How would you keep students engaged during class?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If over Zoom again</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ensure students cameras are on</li>
                                    <li>Students are sitting up not laying down</li>
                                    <li>Questions are met with some form of acknowledgment (shaking/nodding heads, thumbs up, etc.)</li>   
                                </ul>
                            <li>In Person</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Students are maintaining eye contact with the lecturer/ content on screen</li>
                                    <li>Students aren’t on phones</li>
                                </ul>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Others...</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I liked the student teaching weeks, however I wished we had more time to plan after choosing the topics.</li>
                            <li>Having guests from the field like Dr. Degeest was very cool so it was nice for students to see for a brief moment what a day in their chosen career field would look like.</li>
                            <li>While I handled the weekly due dates, I would have preferred a week and a half due date,  so I wasn't rushing through assignments.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

			<h4>Instructor Notes</h4>
			
			<ol>
			<li>How do you work effectively with others?
				
				<ol>
				<li> Asking how do people feel about the project? What are they confident in and not confident in?
				<li> Making yourself open for questions e.g. responding to emails within an hour.
				<li> Let colleagues know that you're less competent than they are. Research the topic, "push self harder," focus on research and let others (more competent) do the programming (Was the less-competent in a data mining class)
				</ol>
			</li>
			
			<li> How are you always on time?
				<ol>
				<li>Upbringing: being on time is late e.g. when volunteering and interning
				<li>Benefit: avoid unknown unknowns e.g. traffic
				<li>Work part-time at fabric aand craft store and arriving early helps with times when store is very full
				</ol>
			</li>
			
			<li>Do you have teaching experience?
			<ol>
				<li>Helped cousin and other students at DMACC. Try not to give answers but instead lead them to answer. But when you get the blank look, then tell them the answer or give a hint.
			</ol>
			</li>
			
			
			<li>Keeping students engaged
				<ol>
				<li> Hard question since we're not in High School so can't be rigid about the rules.
				</ol>
			</li>
			</ol>
