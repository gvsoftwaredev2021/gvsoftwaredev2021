      <h4>What is software development?</h4>
      <li>
        A faction of computer science dedicated to the process of creating,
        designing, deploying, and supporting code to make software.
      </li>

      <h4>
        What are the top 1 (or 2 or 3) lessons you learned from the course?
      </h4>
      <li>
        My top takeaways from this course are how to work with HTML and CSS,
        Git, and self-guided/ group work. Almost everything we did in the course
        was new information to me. I enjoyed learning how to code and work with
        HTML and CSS and while Git was very confusing at first I started to get
        the hang of how to operate it towards the mid to end of the semester.
        Also, the amount of individual and group work was different from other
        classes I've taken, from that I learned more about how to work and
        communicate with a team efficiently and effectively.
      </li>

      <h4>What were the stated learning objectives for the course?</h4>
      <li>
        Learn the full software development lifecycle, to help move an idea from
        the software designer to the end-user. Old and new models of software
        development. Working as a team, and presenting the results of that work.
      </li>

      <h4>When is software development as a group a bad idea?</h4>
      <li>
        I say it would be a bad idea depending on the size of the project. If
        the project doesn't require more than one person having a group could be
        a waste of manpower and could be better utilized doing other projects.
      </li>

      <h4>Describe the software development process used for the class site</h4>
      <li>
        project/requirement outline, planning, designing and developing,
        testing, and deploying.
      </li>

      <h4>
        Which processes that you read about most resemble what we did? Which
        resembled it the least?
      </h4>
      <li>
        Waterfall represented what we did the most. Waterfall is about tasks in
        one phase needing to be reviewed and verified before moving on to the
        other. We did this by outlining a task at the beginning of the week and
        at the end of the due date going over the PRs to verify everything was
        working and looked good. Kanban represents what we did the least because
        kanban is about free-flowing creativity with no deadlines. While we did
        encourage creativity in the class it was held within the restraints of
        the due date of the class to keep the website moving so it could be
        completed by the end of the semester.
      </li>

      <h4>What were the goals of the development process we used?</h4>
      <li>
        I think we hit all areas of the development process just a little out of
        order and sporadic. At the beginning of the year, we knew we wanted to
        create a class site. But instead of outlining everything we wanted to do
        we started immediately and worked out everything as we went. For
        example, we planned the next task, how to style, and how to format
        everything as we went instead of defining everything in the project
        introduction.
      </li>

      <h4>If you're to teach the course, how would you do it?</h4>
      <li>
        One thing I noticed in the class was there was sometimes an issue with
        assignments being turned in on time. While I don't necessarily think
        that everything needs to get graded on a points system I think a
        completion grade for assignments could be beneficial. That way there is
        more incentive to get things turned in on time and if there are issues
        at least there is something turned in to get feedback on instead of not
        turning anything at all and having the rest of the class wondering
        what's going on. I think this class worked well being on zoom rather
        than in person even if COVID didn't play a factor. Since most of our
        “class time” was spent checking in and going over the next task there
        wasn't much need to be in person and most of the time classes were short
        then the remaining time was for work. Another thing I would have changed
        was the organization of the class. At the beginning of the class, we
        came across some issues with some people not knowing how to use and
        operate git. I think some of the first classes should have been
        dedicated to making sure the entire class was on the same page that way
        we could move forward smoothly.
