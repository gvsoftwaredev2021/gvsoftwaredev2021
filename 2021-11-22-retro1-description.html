			<h4> Assignment Description: </h4>
			<p>The Retro One assignment was about students' opinions in regards to what they had already been doing in the first month of this semester. Each student had to imagine repeating the past month of software development for 8 hours/day and 5 days/week and 50 weeks/year for the next year. Then students were to write about what they like/dislike about the class and their overall thoughts on software development as a potential career. After gathering their thoughts, students were then supposed to submit their thoughts in an HTML file to the class GitHub repository with a log of the time they spent working on the assignment.</p>
