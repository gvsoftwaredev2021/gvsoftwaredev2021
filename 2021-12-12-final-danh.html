		<h4>Objectives</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li>The objective of the final assessment is to articulate what was learnt this semester.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>What is "software development"?</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li>In my simple thoughts, software development is building software. That's all. If we use more words, that means we are going to specific cases. That's when the definition leaves the general field and may not fit all cases.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>What's the top 1 (or 2 or 3) lessons you learned from the course?</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li>The top 1 lesson that I learned from the course is about meetings. Leading a meeting is hard. Joining a meeting needs active mindsets to approach meaningful outcomes. Without successful outcomes from meetings, the development could get stuck.</li>
			<li>The next important lesson for me is about keeping the development on track. It's easy to procrastinate. When working in group, working without ethical mindset may lead to blaming on each other for the slow progress, especially when academic projects tend to be loose on individual assignments. Better assignment among members and keeping progress update is vital to the development.</li>
			<li>One other lesson that I value the most is about Git, I didn't play with Git much. All of what I did with Git was through GUI. After the practice with Git, I was even able to upload large file to Github, which is restricted with GUI. Valuable experience.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>What were the stated learning objectives for the course?</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li>My learning objectives for the course was to learn more about Software Development Life Cycle and practice soft skills.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>When is software development as a group a bad idea?</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li>If the scope of work is small, it can be accomplished by one person. Group work is overkill and may lead to more problems than to productivity.</li>
			<li>If team members have very different level of skills and knowledge abstraction, working together may not benefit the whole team.</li>
			<li>When team members come from different background, we need to allocate time for adaptation. It depends on the duration of the project to make it success.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Describe the software development process used for the class site</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li>Each class session can be considered as the meeting time for the whole team/class.</li>
			<li>We determine the work for the week, which can be considered a short sprint.</li>
			<li>Normally, each week has 3 class session, so those could be considered 3 stand-up meetings. The time between meeting is the development time.</li>
			<li>Sometimes, we do retros. From the students' viewpoints, these are chances to reflect and learn. From software development viewpoint, these are chances to reflect the process and find ways to improve the productivity.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Which processes that you read about most resemble what we did? Which resembled it the least?</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li>Scrum is similar to what we did. Waterfall may look the least resembled to what we did.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>What were the goals of the development process we used?</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li>The goal of the process we used was to have something accomplished every week, and we can adapt to changes that we would like to make during the development.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>If you're to teach the course, how would you keep students engaged during class?</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li>Some people may feel easier to present their ideas by writing. We could brainstorm ideas in the meeting, but it should be open for the whole day if someone would like to contribute more ideas. Implementing some restrictions on participation could help.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Instructor Notes</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>"After the practice with Git, I was even able to upload large file to Github, which is restricted with GUI.": apparently the Web GUI limit is ~25MiB
				<li>"When team members come from different background, we need to allocate time for adaptation.": Let people choose their partners at first (maybe let people introduce themselves to the class --Oge). Or let people (instead of a pair of folks) pick their favorite topic and then let them lead the entire class; The leader will be very engaged (even if others won't be quite as much).
				
				<li>"When team members come from different background, we need to allocate time for adaptation.": When brainstorming, give options for people to contribute offline and in writing since not everyone is good at public speaking. Some people are not proactive and need to be goaded to participate.
