    <h4>What is software development?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Software development is a set of 
            computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, 
            deploying, and supporting software.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>What's the top 1 (or 2 or 3) lessons you learned from the course?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Before this class, I did not use HTML
            , and I did not know the basics of it but 
            know I can create a HTML file and design the pages. 
            I also did not know what GitHub or used for but now I can use how GitHub 
            (Like creating PRs and Repositories).</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>What were the stated learning objectives for the course?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The objectives of this course were to learn the full software development lifecycle and how to use UML and coding practices to help move in ideas 
            from the software designer to the end-user. Second, learn old and new models of software development. Third, learn Automated and manual testing that 1) software works as intended,
             and 2) the softwareâ€™s features do not regress over time. Four and last, learn how to work as a team, and present the results of that work.<li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>When is software development as a group a bad idea?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I believe software development as a group is never a bad idea because when working in a group,
             people come up with solid ideas of how to solve things and create things that are solid. 
             It might be a bad idea when people in the group are not participating.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>Describe the software development process used for the class site</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>We worked in groups to build the website with all the assignments and notes in HTML.
             The work was divided into smaller assignments to improve the design and manage time.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>Which processes that you read about most resemble what we did? Which resembled it the least?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The process that we did in class that I read about were: dividing the work into smaller assignments and maintenance (fixing the links that are not working at the end),
             and designing (designing how all the pages will look like).
             Having a plan before starting to work on the project. We did not have the plan of how we wanted our website to look like. I think if we had this, it would have been more easier and it would have not taken as much time as it did.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>What were the goals of the development process we used?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> The goal of the development process we did was to get everyone to participate and learn the process of building a website and to show how it is working as a software developer.</li>
            <li>The class goal - to create a website with all the classwork we did, so that at the end of the class or after graduation we could look back and see what we did. Also, that we could have something to watch that we did in the Software Development Class.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>If you're to teach the course, how would you do it? Some things to
        consider, if you want:
        <br>
                + What grading scheme, if any, would you use?
                <br>
                + Late policy?<br>
                + Missed class policy?<br>
                + Late homework policy?<br>
                + Missed homework policy?<br>
                + How would you keep students engaged during class?<br>
                + others...</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If I was to teach this class. 
            I would teach it the same way Oge Nandi taught it. We had a lot of assignments, 
            but He always helped anybody who had issues or did not understand what the assignment was, 
            or did not know what to do. He also made everybody participate which is a good thing.
             Because in the software development field everybody has to participate in the group.
             This helped develop our communication and public speaking skills</li>
        </ul>
