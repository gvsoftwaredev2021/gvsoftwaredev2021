    <h4> Final assessment questions:</h4>
    <p>Please click on the arrows to see my response to every question below:</p>
    <details>
    <summary>What is "software development"?</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>My general definition of "software development" is the whole process of gathering clientele's business idea and then turn it into a work-able software program through;- <br>
        specifically designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing it and finally deploying it, then maintaining it by providing technical support such as updated versions etc.</li>
    </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>What's the top 1 (or 2 or 3) lessons you learned from the course?</summary>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Team working:</b> This class envolved every student in hands-on project and every student benefited from each others skills as we were being paired up with different team member each new assignment.</li>
        <li><b>GitHub</b> Before this class I barerly knew GitHub and its usefulness, but though using it almost every week I have came to know its importance to me as a future professional software developer</li>
    </ol>
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>What were the stated learning objectives for the course?</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn the full software development lifecycle, and how to use UML and coding practices to help move an idea from the software designer to the end-user.</li>
        <li>Old and new models of software development.</li>
        <li>Automated and manual testing that 1) software works as intended, and 2) the softwareâ€™s features do not regress over time.</li>
        <li>Working as a team, and presenting the results of that work.</li>
    </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Describe the software development process used for the class site</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>I think for a larger percentage of the project we implemented/applied <b>Agile</b> development principal which is a phrase used to describe methodologies for incremental software development. It is an alternative to traditional project management where emphasis is placed on empowering people to collaborate and make team decisions in addition to continuous planning, continuous testing and continuous integration.<br>
            Even though this methodology rely entirely on high degree of customers involvement for testing and also requires high level of dedication and commitment, I think it helped us staying focused and ensure timely delivery of our weekly assignments. It also gave every student an opportunity to learn new things. </li>
              </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Which processes that you read about most resemble what we did? Which resembled it the least?</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>In my opinion I think at some point we used both <b>Agile</b> and <b>Waterfall</b> processes in our project. I can see Agile process being used when we use the breaking out of small segments of our project and work on designated task for the specific week before moving to another. <br>
          Waterfall process was used as we were working on specialized tasks which at the end of the week, we would review and verify them before moving to the next phase. It was a linear and sequential approach, where phases flew downward (waterfalls) to the next.
             </li>
              </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>What were the goals of the development process we used?</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>I think the main goal as specified in our course objectives was to ensure that students are engaged fully in learning software development lifecycle with hands-on project and also allowing them to challenge there critical thinking in solving problems, which was achieved beyond expectation. </li>
              </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>If you're to teach the course, how would you do it? Some things to consider, if you want:</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>What grading scheme, if any, would you use? -> <b>I would use the same as per the current syllabus</b></li>
        <li>Late policy? -> <b>Same same as per the current syllabus</b></li>
        <li>Missed class policy? -> <b>Same same as per the current syllabus</b></li>
        <li>Late homework policy? -> <b> 5% of after 24hrs late submission.</b></li>
        <li>Missed homework policy? -> <b>give students chance to do the homework provided they come up with justified reason for missing it.</b></li>
        <li>How would you keep students engaged during class? -> <b>Same approach we used in class</b></li>
        <li>I would also add the aspect of mobile application development since this area is currently highly utilized with highest customers demand</li>
    </ul>
