<h1>Defining Success- Morgan Gant</h1>
<h2>Class Goals:</h2>
<p>Over the summer I took an Intro to Data Science class and it made me want to become a data scientist. I learned that Data Scientists work <br/>in teams and the most successful Data Scientists know how each element of their team works. <br/>So even though I’m not the most interested in Software development, having knowledge in this area will help me be a better team leader and make my job easier.<br/> I also think that having many skills is important so if I can gain software development skills it will make me more well-rounded, a better asset. <br/>To make this happen, I want to learn the basics of Software Developing because I know absolutely nothing about it. <br/>This includes the different types of software, the history of software, the life cycles, common challenges and any other interesting aspects I learn along the way! <br/>This will be the most beneficial if I better my relationships with others in the class. I feel we can learn just as much from our <br/>peers as we can a professor, especially when classmates that have personal experience in the field. <br/>I have had class with some of these students <br/>before but the classes weren’t very interactive so I didn’t get to gauge what knowledge they have to offer. We talked about soft skills <br/>like teamwork and communication and the only way to improve on them is to implement them!<br/> 

So, my overall goal is to understand the basics and learn how I can apply it to better myself in my desire of becoming a Data Scientist! <br/>I am a really organized person and work very hard on my schooling. I like to know things ahead of <br/>time so I can plan accordingly and I always try to get my work done as early as possible to avoid being stressed. <br/>Life does not run on a schedule though, so I know things will change <br/>and I will get things thrown at me that might cause panic but if I can accomplish my work in a reasonable <br/>timely manner and show my growth throughout the course, I feel that I will be successful no matter what this semester brings. </p>
