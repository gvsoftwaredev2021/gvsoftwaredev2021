    <h4> What is software development? </h4>
    <p> Software development is the process of designing, creating, testing, debugging, deploying, and maintaining software. </p> 
</section>
<section>
    <h4> What were the top three lessons you learned from the course? </h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Tasks that are difficult at first are often the most rewarding </li>
        <li> Time management and planning out tasks are very important skills to learn </li>
        <li> Communication in collaborative tasks is the key to successful completion of such tasks </li>
    </ol> 
</section>
<section>
    <h4> What were the stated learning objectives for the course? </h4>
    <p> The stated learning objectives for the course were: </p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Learn the full software development lifecycle, and how to use UML and coding practices to help move an idea from the software designer to the end-user.</li>
        <li>Old and new models of software development.</li>
        <li>Automated and manual testing that:
            <ul>
                <li>software works as intended</li>
                <li>the softwareâ€™s features do not regress over time</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Working as a team, and presenting the results of that work.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h4> When is software development as a group a bad idea? </h4>
    <p> Software development as a group is a bad idea when the task can be completed more efficiently by one person. Essentially, it comes down to the saying of "too many cooks in the kitchen." After a certain point, adding another person will just get in the way of the other person. </p> 
</section>
<section>
    <h4> Describe the software development process used for the class site </h4>
    <p> The software development process used in class was one with weekly tasks and regular meetings to discuss progress and/or voice any difficulties we were having. These weekly tasks were usually done individually but some required collaboration with other members of the class. After completing the task, pull requests were submitted in order to add the work done to the class site. If there were issues, we had to correct them before getting our requests merged. </p> 
</section>
<section>
    <h4> Which processes that you read about most resemble what we did? Which resembled it the least? </h4>
    <p> I would say that our process most resembles a Scrum or Agile approach. This is because we had weekly "sprints" for the tasks and meetings to discuss our progress.</p>
    <p> I would say Kanban or Waterfall resembled our work the least. Kanban is unlike our process because it does not have hard deadlines on tasks and is more free flowing. Waterfall is different than our process because it is unflexible and changes made to the plan requires a complete restart.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h4> What were the goals of the development process we used? </h4>
    <p> The goals of the development process we used were to learn more about software development and become better overall programmers. We accomplished these things by building the class website. Through building the class website, we were able to learn and practice new things. Ultimately, making us better and more knowledgeable programmers. </p> 
</section>
<section>
    <h4> If you're to teach the course, how would you do it? </h4>
    <p> Honestly, I really liked the project-oriented nature of the course. I think learning through doing has allowed me to become an better programmer. However, does not mean I would not change anything. Below, I've listed out somethings I would change to the course and an explaination why.</p> 
    <ul>
        <li> Grading - I'd love to get some type of feedback on the work I've done throughout the course. Whether it be letter grades or just something that says what I've turned in is up to the class standard. </li>
        <li> Late Work - If everyone turned in things on time, then it would not be necessary. However, as an extra motivator to get things done, some type of late policy should be included. This is mainly because some of our tasks required classmates to turn something in before we could complete our own tasks. </li>
        <li> Projects - Maybe instead of a singular class website, we did two or three small groups building their own websites. With less people per group, I think there could be more collaboration. Also, you'd be able to see different approaches to the same task rather than having everyone do the exact same thing. </li>
    </ul>

		<h4>Instructor Notes</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>"Tasks that are difficult at first are often the most rewarding ": Hadn't written a site before. Cool to see results of work at the end of semester.
				<li>" Time management and planning out tasks are very important skills to learn": at beginning did everything last minute and turned in unfinished work. Used a physical planner to note due dates, and key milestones. Liked checking off tasks.
				<li>"Communication in collaborative tasks is the key to successful completion of such tasks ": In early project with Madeline, talked out different understanding. Would have loved to see the transcripts of your chats --Oge.
				
				<li>"Grading...": Even just acknowledgement that assignment was turned in at all, and on time, and it worked. 
				<li>"Projects...": Having diversity of approaches (by having multiple teams) is nice for learning different approaches. Smaller teams gives 				 more chances for folks' special talents to be emphasized.
			</ol>
