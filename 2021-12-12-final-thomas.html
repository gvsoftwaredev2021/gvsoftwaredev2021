    <h3>What is "Software development"?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The designing and testing of applications</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>What's the top 1 (or 2 or 3) lessons you learned from this course?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing HTML</li>
            <li>Working as a team is a double-bladed sword</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>What were the stated learning objectives for the course?</h3>   
        <ul>
            <li>Working as a team</li>
            <li>Learning different ways to accomplish the same task</li>
            <li>Researching new topics and finding ways to apply what was learned</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>When is software development as a group a bad idea?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For such simple tasks that working as a group would only slow it down and cause more problems.</li>
            <li>I think a lot of the things we did would've been better to do individually</li>


    <h3>Describe the software development process used for the class site</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Each week we were given a different task to be completed by the end of the week before the next week started for a different task. Students led different weeks in pairs of 2 and had to work together to think of a plan that the rest of the class could work on for that week</li>


    <h3>Which processes that you read about most resemble what we did? Which resembled it the least?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Scrum the most because Work is set to be done by the end of the week and we are like the development team and you are the overseer. Continous learning, we learned as time went on.</li>
            <li>Kanban the least because work is expected to be done within a certain time period.</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>What were the goals of the development process we used?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Get things done at a certain time so we could add them to the website</li>
            <li>We learned new things as time went on, found interesting ways to do things we previously did a different way</li>
            <li>To get a feel for what an actual software development job could be like</li>
        </ul> 


    <h3>If you're to teach the course, how would you do it?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Participation and attempting to try for a grade</li>
            <li>Each student would individually make their own website including only their files</li>
            <li>Everything would be due at the end of the year since it is not focused on one website for the whole class</li>
            <li>Each week there would be something to say where each person should be at in there work to not fall behind</li>
            <li>There would be no late work because it is all due at the end so you just need to be finished by the end of the semester</li>
            <li>No punishment for missing class unless it is excessive. Should be expected to watch zoom recording if gone</li>
            <li>Each week should focus on a topic such as a first retro and Monday, Wednesday, and Friday can be broken up into work days like we did with each pair of students leading class</li>
            <li>Students would be able to upload their work to their website as they progress and that way be able to get feedback from you and other students along the way</li>
        </ul>

		<h4>Instructor Notes</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>"Working as a team is a double-bladed sword": Most of the time just one person did the work. Exception: breakout session assignment. 
				Tried to make the assignments in his week more individual. Better project idea: let everyone make their own site then hold a contest to pick the best aspects to put into a final website. Or both people work in parallel and pick the best implementation.
				<li>Software development is more like baseball than like basketball: only few people need to DO stuff at any one time.
				<li>"Teamwork sucks sometimes" --Mr. Thomas.
