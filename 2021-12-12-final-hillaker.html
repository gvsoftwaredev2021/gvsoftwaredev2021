<h3> What is "software development"?</h3>
 
 <p>Software development is the process of coming up with, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and fixing bugs while creating and maintaining applications, and frameworks.</p>
 
<h3>What's the top 1 (or 2 or 3) lessons you learned from the course?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Time management</li>
<li>Teamwork</li>
<li>Github</li>
</ol>
<h3>What were the stated learning objectives for the course?</h3>
 
<h3>Course Objective I</h3>
<p>Learn the full software development lifecycle, and how to use UML
and coding practices to help move an idea from the software
designer to the end-user.</p>
<h3>Course Objective 2</h3>
<p>Old and new models of software development.</p>
<h3>Course Objective 3</h3>
<p>Automated and manual testing that 1) software works as intended,
and 2) the software’s features do not regress over time.</p>
<h3>Course Objective 4</h3>
<p>Working as a team, and presenting the results of that work</p>
 
<h3>- When is software development as a group a bad idea?</h3>
 
<p>I think that if there is a very linear project where tasks mostly have to happen one after the other then a group setting might not be the best. It could be easy to have everyone bottleneck waiting for some task before theirs to get completed before they can begin their own work. I also think that if you are developing something for fun or something you are very passionate about it could be possible that it wouldn’t lend itself to being a group project very well. There could be differing ideas on the project or different standards of work that will result in a clunky, awkward end product.</p>
 
<h3>- Describe the software development process used for the class site</h3>
 
<p>In class we were given assigned tasks to complete within a week long sprint. We would receive our task, work through it, ask follow up questions, and have a short retro at the end of the week. This process worked fairly well I think and allowed us time to do each task but also time for questions (usually on Wednesdays) and alterations to the task requirements if needed.</p>
 
<h3>- Which processes that you read about most resemble what we did? Which
            	resembled it the least?</h3>
 
<p>I think that our process most resembled an agile and scrum methodology. It was a little bit different because we did week long sprints instead of 2 week sprints. </p>
               
<h3>- What were the goals of the development process we used?</h3>
 
<p>Our goals were to have a week-long sprint with a task or tasks being outlined at the beginning of each sprint. We could ask any questions as the week went on and adjust. This allowed for clear guidelines with a little bit of flexibility. Also, it allowed each of us the opportunity to lead class.</p>
 
</h4> If you're to teach the course, how would you do it? Some things to
consider, if you want:</h4>
 
            	<h3>+ What grading scheme, if any, would you use?</h3>
<p>I think it would be helpful to give out a grade for every sprint or maybe every other sprint so that students have a little bit more of an idea of how they are performing.</p>
 
            	<h3>+ Late policy?</h3>
<p>I don’t think I would keep track of who was late but I would start on time and if you missed something then it would be on you.</p>
 
            	<h3>+ Missed class policy?</h3>
<p>I think that I would not keep track of attendance in most classes.</p>
 
            	<h3>+ Late homework policy?</h3>
<p>I think that I would probably have a grace period of a day or two but it would go down with each following day. However, I would allow for homework to be turned in late at any time for no more than 50% of the total assignment. </p>
 
            	<h3>+ Missed homework policy?</h3>
<p>As I said in the above question. You could turn it in for 50%. But if you don’t turn anything in it will be a 0
 
            	<h3>+ How would you keep students engaged during class?</h3>
<p>I think I would have them lead class as was done in this class. That helped keep everyone engaged quite a bit.</p>

		<h4>Instructor Notes</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>"Time management": Had less time due to family issues this semester. Having a backup  time to scheduled time for homework.
				<li>"Teamwork": Its nice to have responsive teammates during the week that he led.
				<li>"Github": At internship, no collaboration with github. Class gave experience with dealing with conflicts, and branches.
