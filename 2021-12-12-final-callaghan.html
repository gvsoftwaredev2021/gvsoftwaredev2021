                <h4>1. What is software development?</h4>
                
                <ul>
                <li>Software development is the process of planning, creating, and implementing code for the development of applications.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. What's the top 1 (or 2 or 3) lessons you learned from the course?</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>I think the biggest lesson that I've learned from this course is the power of reflection during the process of software development. When we discussed each assignment as a class and said, "What went well? What did not go well? And what can we improve upon?" we had actually defined and outlined where we needed to make things better. From here, we made our next steps for the assignments. Overall, the end goal was to have a final class website product, and the reflection process made sure that we stayed on track towards this goal and that we made the best possible version of the site.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. What were the stated learning objectives for the course?</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>From the syllabus, the stated course learning objectives are as follows:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learn the full software development lifecycle, and how to use UML and coding practices to help move an idea from the software designer to the end-user.</li>
                            <li>Old and new models of software development.</li>
                            <li>Automated and manual testing that 1) software works as intended, and 2) the softwareâ€™s features do not regress over time.</li>
                            <li>Working as a team, and presenting the results of that work.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>My initial learning objectives from the "Defining Success" assignment are as follows:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gain a broad understanding of software development</li>
                        <li>Learn how it is implemented in the real world</li>
                        <li>Learn how it can be applied in the field of data analytics</li>
                        <li>Being able to collaborate/communicate with my groupmates will be a great measure for success</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. When is software development as a group a bad idea?</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>I think that software development as a group is a bad idea when there is a lot of overlap between what people are working on. For any given assignment, not every student is necessarily on the same page when it comes to ideas or how to attack a problem. When it is a very individualized software development assignment, I would prefer to work on it myself and then have it evaluated and critiqued within the group or team setting. I think that for the most part in this class, the coding was better suited for individual work. My idea would be for everyone to have a specific area for which to work on the assignment or task (no overlap) and then when completed, the group or team would come together to evaluate and reflect.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5. Describe the software development process used for the class site.</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>I think that for building our class site, we went through all expected stages. Initally, we plotted out what we wanted to do for each assignment and then evaluated/edited. Then, as we decided that our end goal was a class website, we started from the ground up thinking about the design, layout, content, and user experience for the site. For each assignment that followed, we followed this same process. We plotted out what we wanted to accomplish, completed the assignment or work, and edited/formatted the work all focused on improving the user experience of the site. Every step of the way was focusing on continuing to improve the site, one step at a time.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>6. Which processes that you read about most resemble what we did? Which resembled it the least?</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>I think that as a class, we focused mainly on the design and maintenance stages of the software development process. The work in these two stages most resembles what we did throughout the course. I think that a thorough planning stage was missing from the process that we followed. If we had a bit more foresight and planning into what we wanted the site to look like or accomplish, we could have improved/simplified the whole process.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>7. What were the goals of the development process we used?</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>The overall goal of the development process that we used was to create a website where we could showcase off the work that we have done for the semester. At the end of the process, we have built something as a class, but there were also small goals along the way that made the process possible. I would say that some of these sub-goals were: learning how to effectively comminucate/work as a team, learning how to emerge as a leader and organize an assignment for the week, learning how to reflect on previous work in order to make improvements moving forward, and learning how a real-world software development team functions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>8. If you're to teach the course, how would you do it?</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Grading scheme:  I think that basing grades on the amount of time put in is a good system. Also, each team having a chance to lead class discussion and an assignment for a week is a potential area for grade evaluation as well. You could evaluate people based on how well they participated in the assignment by their classmates and whether they were devoted to doing a good job. On top of this, individuals could be evaluated on how well they were able to emerge as a leader for their assigned week, their strength of communication with the class, and their overall organization for the week.</li>

                    <li>Late policy: Really, there should be no exceptions for late work. If a student group is devoting a lot of time to organizing a weekly assignment, the class should be expected to complete it in a timely manner. If there is late work, its value should be reduce (maybe worth half of its original value) if submitted late and it should hurt the overall participation grade for that week. Turning in late work is a sign of not being a good team member, and there are no excuse for that in the real-world.</li>

                    <li>Missed class policy: If absent for a class, the student should be responsible for listening to class recordings for any sort of notes or mention of upcoming assignments. In university, there are tons of reasons why a student may not be able to attend a class, and I think that it is acceptable if they make the effort to inform the professor and listen to the recorded lecture.</li>

                    <li>Late homework policy: I think that late homework should lose half of its original value. Turning in late work shows poor participation for the week, and it really lets other group members down by not contributing a part. </li>

                    <li>Missed homework policy: I think that completely missing homework assignments should receieve a 0% grade after about two weeks late. It is just a complete failure to provivde or contribute to your team. In the real-world, there is no tolerance for having missing work, so that is the process we should mimic.</li>

                    <li>Keeping student engaged: I think that having every group organize a class discussion and weekly assignment is a great way to keep people engaged because it offers a fresh assignment and structure to follow. Also, the idea of having an in-class assignment for each class session would help to make sure people stay engaged. Even if this assignment is one simple question, it would make people focus during the discussion. Similar to this, I have found through experience that randomly calling on students for questions throughout the lecture almost forces them to pay attention and keeps them on their toes.</li>
                </ul>

			<h4>Instructor Notes</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>"the power of reflection during the process": doesn't work if ppl are not invested in the process, don't provide feedback; important to also provide constructive, individual feedback.
				<li>How to solicit individual feedback?: He worked it into the week he led, with each sub-group critiquing another group; thereby removing the pressure to speak in front of big group.
				
				<li>Saw benefits of the teamwork aspects class when went to visit team for next semester's internsip
				
				<li>"When is software development as a group a bad idea?" How to avoid conflicts?: Have a brainstorming session before class starts to figure out general structure; more planning. Choral singers vs jam bands
				
				<li>"Keeping students engaged"; when have you felt most engaged in class?: Perhaps 20-30m assignment at the end of the class (solved together, submitted individually). He feels disengaged in classes in which: lecture the entire time, non-interactive. This leads to not paying attention since you're sure you won't understand until you interact with the material at home.
